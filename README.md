<br />
<i><strong>com.czipperz.cLibrary.exceptions</i></strong> has general exceptions for the classes and an exception handler, CExceptionParser.

<br />
<i><strong>com.czipperz.cLibrary.game.directions</i></strong> has directions in different forms (4 basic in one class, while diagonals are included in another).
<br />
<i><strong>com.czipperz.cLibrary.gui</i></strong> contains basic gui elements.

<br />
<i><strong>com.czipperz.cLibrary.location</i></strong> includes classes to control Mouse movements as well as CPoint and CRect that allow for easy creation of Points and Rectangles, respectively.

<br />
<i><strong>com.czipperz.cLibrary.utils</i></strong> general utilities, such as a customizable Color and great thread control.
