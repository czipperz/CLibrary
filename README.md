#CLibrary
A library that assists in many tasks but mainly focuses on graphics on JFrames.

------------------------------------------------
#Packages
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary**_ has a few general classes.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.collision**_ has classes that test the collision between two image objects based on their x,y positions.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.exceptions**_ has general exceptions for the classes and an exception handler, CExceptionParser.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.game**_ has many classes to control drawing and updating CIDDrawAble objects.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.game.controller**_ contains classes to draw controller output as well as interpret it logically as an XBox or PS3 controller.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.game.directions**_ has directions in different forms (4 basic in one class, while diagonals are included in another).
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.gui**_ contains basic gui elements.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.imaging**_ contains implementations of CImage that allow for easy drawing of specific tasks that don't need updating or are prebuilt.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.location**_ includes classes to control Mouse movements as well as CPoint and CRect that allow for easy creation of Points and Rectangles, respectively. (CPoint stores variables as doubles so that you can round when you display on screen instead of having to round mid calculation, giving more precision.)
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.tests**_ tests of the classes
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.utils**_ general utilities, such as a customizable Color and great thread control.
* _**io.czipperz.github.cLibrary.utils.collections**_ utilities relating to collections.
